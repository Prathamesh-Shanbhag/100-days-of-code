# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Prathamesh Shanbhag]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [March 19, Friday, 2021].

## Log

### R1D1

Learnt about Functions/ES6 Syntax
IFFE,Hoisting,Closure, Usage of Var Let Const,Function/Block Scope,Template Strings,String Interpolation,Tagged Template Literals(Temp Literals + Functions)

### R1D2

Started Learning Docker, Attended A Webinar on Machine Learning.
Helped a friend to start learning about Git & GitHub(made their very first repo!), and also Website Hosting via FireBase.
Under JavaScript I learnt about

- 'This' Keyword in ES6 & Normal Functions
- Default Parameters in Functions
- Destructuring Arrays
- Swapping Variables
- Destructuring Objects by itself & using Functions.
- New String Methods introduced in ES6 Javascript
- For of Loop

### R1D3

Decided to Complete with ES6 major concepts today and I am almost done with JavaScript.
Topics I Covered:

- Spread Operator
- Rest Operator
- ES6 Array Methods
- Modularizing of Code as done in React
- Callback,Promises & Async/Await.

### R1D4

Potential Final Day of Javascript(Will be moving on to REACT soon! Yayy!)
All from very basics

- Callbacks,Promises and Async/Await
- AJAX,HTTP,API Requests
- Created a Random Joke Generator project using these concepts.
  Watched Eddie on Youtube Reviewing OpenSource Projects Live
- All my knowledge on Opensource has been through Eddie and the EddieHub Community.
- Learnt a lot about how to make a good open source project some points include
- Include Version Releases
- Include GitHub Actions
- Have a well documented readme file
- Create labels for issues and create issues too!
- Include Important Project links in respective places.

### R1D5

Took it a litle easy today, was really sleep deprived, although still managed to complete two projects.
JavaScript Cocktails API Project & Random User Generator Project

- The API's used were CocktailsDB API and RandomUser API
- Made use of all AJAX Concepts like fetch, async/await.
- Also modularized the code!

COCKTAILS API PROJECT

This is one project I would recommend to others , who want to fortify their JavaScript Basics,because this project will touch on those topics from the start very well.
I really had fun making this project, Do check it out and let me know your thoughts on it!
LINK IN BIO!

### R1D6

- GETTING STARTED WITH REACT!

- Posting really late but I Finally Started with React and got introduced to create-react-app the ready-to-go template for react web-apps.
- Although I couldn't get started with much of React Concepts, I just snooped around the file structure and learnt what it contained along with the important terminal commands that will be required to build my project.
- Prepared a presentation on my final year project(which took up most of my day and React Concepts will have to wait for a bit.) & this project requires me to get started with Machine Learning using Python and also learn about OpenCV, Dlib,and TensorFlow to create the model and React for the Front-End of this Project.
- Any suggestions or resources of good quality for the project mentioned above will be greatly appreciated in the comments!
- Also Dealt with a minor bug in the cocktails api project which was preventing the fetch request , which stopped the Single Drink Page from Loading.

### R1D7(25th March)

Starting with Basic React Concepts!

- Learning about Components.
- Nested Components.
- Also learnt about JSX.
- Prepping for a 36 Hour Hackathon coming up soon!
- Couldn't do much today since I was super buzy, and will try and catch up soon.

### R1D8

Working with Components.

- Was really buzy since I am taking part in a Hackathon was on call all day and couldn't do the learning part much.
- Although the project has some advanced react concepts, I will have to learn them on the fly, I have a team-mate to help me out.
- Trying to find ways to improve my posts by using canva or so.
- Also attended a live stream by @eddiejaoude and had a really amazing conversation on GitHub and Open-Source.

### R1D9

- Another day spent all day on call and a few meetings for something coming up soon, although I did start with something cool which is creating an account on HackerRank and started with a few Practice tests on there!
- Planning to soon start with Python so it is easy for me to solve the problems on there and probably on LeetCode as well, since the text editor on HackerRank doesn't work with JavaScript very well.(Accepts Node.js JavaScript only)
- Attended the Monthly Community Call w/ @eddiejaoude and as usual it was amazing and inspiring!
  The talks included:
  Talks included :
  Github Kanban Project Board/Actions.
  Web Development/Assembly & TensorFlow for Machine Learning.
  Best Cloud Platforms to host Projects.(Digtal Ocean,AWS, etc)
  How the community is inclusive to all & overcoming the language barrier together!
